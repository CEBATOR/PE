You sit down next to $cheerFriend.name and try to be reassuring. @@.heroT;“Hey, don’t worry about singing in front of those people,”@@ you tell her. @@.heroT;“If anyone can nail your mom’s songs, I know it’s you.”@@

She looks up at you, her face streaked with makeup. @@.cheerFriend;“What would you know about my mom?”@@ she asks angrily. @@.cheerFriend;“It’s not like you ever met her. Hell, it’s not like I even remember that much about her anymore.”@@

You’re taken aback by her aggressive response, and she instantly senses your discomfort and her anger subsides. @@.cheerFriend;“Sorry,”@@ she apologizes. @@.cheerFriend;“It’s just… It’s not about the singing. I did ballet for, like, years. Being on stage isn’t a problem for me, but being around those people who knew my mom, it’s like every time they look at me all they see is her.” She wipes the tears from her eyes.

“None of them even act like they remember she died and left me and my dad behind, and then they all want me to be just like her, when that’s, like, the last thing I want to be.”@@

$cheerFriend.name’s father’s voice comes from behind you. @@.malevoice10;“Oh, honey,”@@ he says as he sits on the other end of the bench from you. @@.malevoice10;“Listen, your mom made a lot of mistakes, but that doesn’t mean that you’ll do the same.”@@ He takes $cheerFriend.name’s hand. @@.malevoice10;“You two are similar in a lot of ways, ways those people will never understand, but what really makes you special is all the ways you're different from her.

“Listen, $cheerFriend.name, All your mom and I ever wanted for you is to be better and happier than we were, and I know she would be so proud of you if she could see you now, because you’re everything that made her great, but different in so many that make you wonderful all on your own.”@@

$cheerFriend.name finally smiles and gives her father a hug. @@.cheerFriend;“Thanks, Dad.”@@

@@.malevoice10;“Do you need me to take you and $cheerleaders.fakeName home?”@@ he asks.

@@.cheerFriend;“I think I’ll be ok,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says. @@.cheerFriend;“We still need to give all these people their show.”@@

He smiles. @@.malevoice10;“Sounds good. I’ll see you back inside.”@@
