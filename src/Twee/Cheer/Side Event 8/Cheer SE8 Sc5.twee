	You move your hand slowly downward toward $cheerFriend.name’s foot, watching for a negative reaction, but $cheerFriend.name does not pull her foot away or admonish you for your wandering hand. You wrap your hands around her exposed foot and press your thumbs into the sole, making small circles. Her foot tenses for a moment at the new contact, then begins to relax against your touch.

	@@.cheerFriend;“That feels good,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says, with a slight moan that makes you tremble. You carefully remove her other slipper and move to her opposite foot, feeling her relax even further in your hand. The feeling of her feet in your hands, her skin against yours, is arousingly intimate, and hearing her let out quiet mewls as you massage her makes your cock harden so strongly it threatens to damage your cage.

	@@.cheerFriend;“We used to rub each other’s feet after ballet class,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says. “I forgot how good it feels.” Her praises are all you need to intensify your massage efforts.

	@@.heroT;“Oh are you?”@@ you ask with a smile.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah. So if you value your life, no tickling,”@@ she warns, her grin making clear that her threat is more of a challenge.

	You grin back at hear, wiggling your fingers menacingly. 

	@@.cheerFriend;“Oh no you don… Ha ha ha ha ha!”@@ Her threat is cut off by laughter as you capture her foot and resume tickling. She squirms on the couch as her foot wriggles, attempting to escape your fingertips. After a few seconds, you pause, giving her a brief respite from your tickling. Your hand moves back to her sole and she sharply jerks her leg, freeing it from your grasp.
