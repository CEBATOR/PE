   You find yourself outside the shoe store, only to discover that the contents are exclusively feminine. From the cut of the brogues, to the horrifying style of the dagger heels, everything they sell is aimed at women. And girls. 

	With no reason to enter the shop, you turn on your heel and head for the mall.

		With the latest demand of $teacher still ringing in your ears like some deafening tolling bell, you find yourself outside the women’s shoe shop, Klip Klops. As you peer into the window from across the concourse you wait for a quiet moment and slink into the shop, momentarily dazzled by the rows of colorful shoes, some bedecked with sequins or rhinestones.

		You quickly scan the shelves for a glimpse of the most basic, boyish-looking shoes you can find, when you hear a husky, alluring voice.
