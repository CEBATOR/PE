It’s not as though you can’t go out looking pretty now.”@@ $friend says sadly, pushing you back out onto the steps. @@.friend;“Maybe if you come back tomorrow, wearing something cute, I’ll take you somewhere nice,”@@ $friendG.he_she adds, slamming the door in your face.

	@@.friend;“Going out for food, with you looking cute and all, especially with me paying? It’s a date!”@@ $friend says, gazing at your <<if window.inventoryFuncs.hasTag(_outer, 'separates')>>skirt and top<<else>>dress<<endif>>. $friendG.He_She leans forward and kisses the tip of your nose. @@.friend;“So, food first, and maybe after, come back and do desert…?”@@

	@@.heroT;“No! I mean, I kinda wanna try something sweet.”@@

	$friend looks mock miffed for a few moments, then grins. @@.friend;“Okay, first you get to eat sweets out, and then when we get home I get to eat my sweetie.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Your jokes get worse,”@@ you say, following $friendG.him_her down to the basement.

	$friend mumbles something to <<if $friendG.gender == "F">>herself<<else>>himself<<endif>>, which might have been ‘who said I was joking’ but $friendG.his_her voice is muffled so you aren’t quite certain and let it drop. You reach the basement garage where $friend opens your door and waits patiently while you settle into the bucket seat, floundering a bit with the ridiculous skirt to stop it riding up your thigh and putting everything on show.

	@@.friend;“I know somewhere cool,”@@ $friend says, revving the engine while the garage door automatically rolls into the ceiling. The moment the metal panel is high enough, $friendG.he_she floors the gas and you shoot up the drive and onto the street.
