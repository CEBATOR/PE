Tucked into a half-empty strip mall, the dinner theater where you are to meet Ms. Ravensong looks more than a little dilapidated, an effect reinforced by the fact that there can’t be more than a dozen cars in the parking lot. You spot Ms. Ravensong standing outside the front door waiting for you.

@@.femvoice10;“Ah, there you are. Shall we head inside?”@@ Ms. Ravensong asks, placing an arm around your shoulders as she leads the way through the double doors. She waves a greeting at the only waitress that appears to be working, before heading across the room and to a table in a dark corner near the back.

You take your seats and have just enough time to place your food order before the lights dim and the show starts.
