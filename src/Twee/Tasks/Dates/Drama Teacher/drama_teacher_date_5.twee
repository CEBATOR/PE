	Ms. Ravensong chuckles. @@.femvoice10;“How sweet, both in sentiment and in phrasing. I am always so heartened to see one of the younger generation who is familiar with the great works of our past. Since you feel so... passionately about the role you chose. Why don’t you give me a bit of a private performance? By that, I mean, I would rather you were under the table and between my legs than sitting beside me.”@@

    You give a resigned shrug. After all, it’s not like your “wants” seem to matter for much anymore.

    Ms. Ravensong seems disappointed by your answer, but the play starts back up, turning her attention back to the stage. Focused on the performance, it isn’t long before she slips her arm away from your shoulder.

    You feel like you made a mistake, but are unable to come up with anything to say to repair things. Eventually the play comes to an end, and Mrs. Ravensong bids you good evening before you each head your separate ways.
