:: comportment_bimbo_2_5
You open the classroom door to find yourself facing Miss Willow and her assistant. She barely acknowledges you as she glides past to greet $teacher, while her assistant gives you an awkward hello before hurrying after her.

@@.hero;Wow, $futa.he_she really has turned into a teacher’s pet... though Miss Willow doesn’t have anywhere near the aura of dominance that $teacher does.@@

The two women exchange pleasantries and $teacher makes a subtle motion for you to stand next to her as their conversation continues. Miss Willow ignores you and instead asks $teacher for advice on planning out an upcoming unit on “human sexual deviancy.”
