:: comportment_etiquette_2_walk
You have what feels like one of the longest walks ever, from the mall. Every step sends the already raging plug to shift and wiggle against your too-sensitive prostate as you war between clamping down  and almost crying out when it decides to "help" by sending a sphincter-tightening shock through your body.

In something of a daze, you eventually stumble through the door of the classroom. $teacher is waiting for you<<if $lessonPlug>> your old plug in her hand<<endif>>. @@.teacher;”I hope you enjoyed your little stroll,”@@ she says with an impish smirk. @@.teacher;“I believe this is yours.  Now be a good girl and bring me back the plug I gave you.<<if $lessonPlug>> I’m sure your old plug is ready to be back in its home.<<endif>>”@@

You <<if $lessonPlug>>take the plug from her hand, stagger into the bathroom, <<else>>stagger into the bathroom <<endif>>and gingerly remove the torture device she inserted into you<<if _plug>>, replacing it with your old plug<<endif>>.
