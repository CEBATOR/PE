Now, go refill my glass before I have you spend the rest of the evening serving champagne with the bottle shoved up your ass.”@@

	You gulp fearfully and hurry off to find the kitchen, glass in hand.

<</switch>>\

Weaving your way through the scattered party goers, you manage to find the kitchen without being stopped by more than a handful of guests offering complimentary to lewd comments about your appearance. Opening a fresh bottle of champagne, you fill $teacher’s glass and take a moment to catch your breath when you hear a slightly slurred voice from behind.

You freeze up at the feeling of <<if $kink.futa>>her<<else>>his<</if>> hand on your ass, and you look around for help. There are several other people within sight, but even though a few of them are looking in your direction, none of them seem interested in preventing the <<if $kink.futa>>woman<<else>>man<</if>> from accosting you.
