	She rises to her feet and motions for you to do the same. @@.teacher;“It seems a shame not to take advantage of that wonderful punishment you proposed. Now I do not have a classroom of peers handy to properly embarrass you, but I do have a nice flogger handy. Perhaps this will make things sufficiently interesting...”@@

	She grabs your arms and soon has you hanging by the wrists from a hook on the ceiling with your back exposed to the cool air of the room.
