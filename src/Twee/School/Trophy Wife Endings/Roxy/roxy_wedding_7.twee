The after-party passes in a blur. What could compare to the mad intensity of the wedding ceremony? You mostly stand around on Roxy’s arm like the good “trophy wife” you are, accepting congratulations and good wishes from your various friends. There is drinking and carousing, even a spot of fighting as Roxy’s teammates show the groomsmen who //really// deserves to carry the newlyweds to their nuptial bed.

Reminiscent of your proposal, you find yourself carried aloft by her team-mates. One goes a step further as they helpfully tie you to the bed as Roxy strips naked.

Once the other four women are gone, it is just you and your wife. She unlocks your cage and stands at the foot of the bed looking down at you with a smile. @@.shopphoto;“Now  you wear my ring, my collar, and are bound to me in the eyes of law, god and everyone we know…”@@ she says. @@.shopphoto;“There’s no escape, not I from you, or you from me... and now? Now we are going. to. fuck.”@@
