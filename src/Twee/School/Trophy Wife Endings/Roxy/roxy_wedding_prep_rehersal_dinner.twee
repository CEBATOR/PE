<<case 1>>\

	$futa.He_She seems a little confused at her attention, asking if they have met before.

	@@.shopphoto;“Technically no but… well, let me just say I am a BIG… fan.”@@

	She grins at glances at $futa.his_her crotch where there is already a noticeable bulge.
	<<else>>\
    	@@.shopphoto;“You couldn’t convince that hot guy on the $team.sport team? Hmm... disappointing, but I will make do. Run along, my dear. I need to take care of figuring out who is the true best man...”@@

	@@.shopphoto;“I made a mental note to show you some techniques and get some practice in during the honeymoon. Think about it: if I want to lay around in bed all day, but //also// get railed in all three holes... how does that happen if you aren’t up to the challenge?”@@

	You mumble a bashful apology but she reaches out to grab your collar, pulling you in for a kiss. @@.shopphoto;“Aww, you’re so cute when you know you’ve been naughty. Don’t you worry about a thing, your wife has this aaaalllll taken care of. HEY, YOU!”@@ She shouts at a cluster of <<if $kink.futa>>tall women<<else>>guys<</if>> - friends of hers that had volunteered to be waiters for the reception.

	She gives you a slap on the ass. @@.shopphoto;“Well, go on and thank them for helping out... And by that I mean suck them off. If it gets back to me that you failed to take four shots down that sexy mouth fuck-hole, well... you’ve heard of Bridezilla, right?...”@@

	You promise to do her proud.
    
	She kisses you on the cheek. @@.shopphoto;“I know you will, that’s why I’m marrying you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to help you out and figure out who is the ACTUAL best man.”@@
