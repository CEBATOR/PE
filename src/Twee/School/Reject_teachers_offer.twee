::Reject_teachers_offer
You tell $teacher that you're not comfortable taking her offer.

She frowns and says, @@.teacher;"While I think you're making the wrong decision, I understand. It seems we will just have to wonder what could have been, then."@@

She retrieves your notebook and pencil and plops them on your desk. @@.teacher;"Now, write 'I will not steal girl's panties' one hundred times, if you please."@@

You sigh and start to scribble the words on the page, having resigned yourself to a life of endless detention and a mundane future.

''The End''
